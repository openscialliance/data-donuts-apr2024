## Goal: Make Research Reproducible

What?

## Different kinds of "reproducible"

Reproducible
Replicable
Robust
Generalizable

Today, we're focused on "Reproducible"

::: {.notes}
We're focused today on the reproducible dimension, but it's good to know and understand these other dimensions, as Open Science encompasses them all.

## Goal: Make Research Reproducible

Why?

::: {.notes}
Take a poll on the "why"!

Some good answers:
 - Scientific evidence is strengthened if it can be replicated by others ("standing on the shoulders of giants")
 - Builds trust in the community
 - Gives researchers a "head start" on new investigations
 - "Negative results" can be published easily, helping others avoid time wasting pitfalls

1. Track a complete history of your work ("Provenance")
2. Facilitate collaboration and review
3. Build confidence in published work
4. Get credit for your work
5. Ensure continuity
6. Efficiency!

Yes, efficiency! There's admittedly a start-up cost in adopting these strategies, but time-saving across the board when we're confident our work is reproducible.

## Goal: Make Research Reproducible

How?

Lots of ways!

::: {.notes}
TONS of ways to make your work reproducible. Today we'll only cover a few.
:::

## Barriers to Reproducibility

If reproducibility is so great, why are we here in 2024 learning about it?

::: {.notes}
Again, take a poll. Some good answers:

 - publication bias toward novel results
 - too much time
 - requires learning new skills
 - no reward (e.g. job promotion)
 - personal: people might discover I'm wrong
:::

## Reproducibility is hard

Fortunately, reproducibility is not "all-or-nothing"; even _some_ elements are better than none!

**Today, let's focus on "good enough": the least amount of work to get a respectably reproducible research project.**

## What we'll cover today

::: {.incremental}
1. Version control
   - No command line; just web
   - Folder structure for your project
   - Set up on GitHub
2. Licensing
   - Sounds boring, I know
   - Very important if anyone who isn't you will be using your code or data
3. Environments
   - Where most of the difficulty arises ("it works on _my_ computer...")
   - Introduce BinderHub
