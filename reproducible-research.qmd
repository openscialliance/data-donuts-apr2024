## Goal: Make Research Reproducible

What?

![_The Turing Way_ project illustration by Scriberia. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3332807).](assets/research-cycle.svg)

## Different kinds of "reproducible"

![[DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3332807).](assets/reproducible-matrix.jpg)

Today, we're focused on "Reproducible"

::: {.notes}
We're focused today on the reproducible dimension, but it's good to know and understand these other dimensions, as Open Science encompasses them all.
:::

## Goal: Make Research Reproducible

Why?

::: {.notes}
Take a poll on the "why"!

Some good answers:
 - Scientific evidence is strengthened if it can be replicated by others ("standing on the shoulders of giants")
 - Builds trust in the community
 - Gives researchers a "head start" on new investigations
 - "Negative results" can be published easily, helping others avoid time wasting pitfalls

1. Track a complete history of your work ("Provenance")
2. Facilitate collaboration and review
3. Build confidence in published work
4. Get credit for your work
5. Ensure continuity
6. Efficiency!

Yes, efficiency! There's admittedly a start-up cost in adopting these strategies, but time-saving across the board when we're confident our work is reproducible.
:::

## Goal: Make Research Reproducible {auto-animate="true"}

How?

::: {.notes}
TONS of ways to make your work reproducible. Today we'll only cover a few.
:::

## Goal: Make Research Reproducible {auto-animate="true"}

How?

**Lots of ways!**

::: {.notes}
Hopefully got a few ideas from the introduction slides about Open Science. Are there other ideas?
:::

## Barriers to Reproducibility {auto-animate="true"}

If reproducibility is such a great thing to ensure in research, why are we here in 2024 learning about it (possibly for the first time)?

::: {.notes}
Again, take a poll. Some good answers:

 - publication bias toward novel results
 - too much time
 - requires learning new skills
 - no reward (e.g. job promotion)
 - personal: people might discover I'm wrong

## Barriers to Reproducibility {auto-animate="true"}

If reproducibility is such a great thing to ensure in research, why are we here in 2024 learning about it (possibly for the first time)?

![A slide outlining some of the barriers to reproducible research from Kirstie Whitaker‚Äôs [talk about The Turing Way](https://youtu.be/wZeoZaIV0VE?t=312) at [csv,conf,v4](https://csvconf.com/2019) in May 2019. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2669547)](assets/barriers-reproducibility.png)

## Reproducibility is hard

Fortunately, reproducibility is not "all-or-nothing."

Even _some_ reproducibility is better than none!

**Today, let's focus on "good enough": the least amount of work to get a respectably reproducible research project.**

## What we'll cover

::: {.incremental}
1. üîÅ Version control
2. ü™™ Licensing
3. üåÖ Environments
:::

::: {.notes}
Versioning:
 - No command line git or coding; just a web interface and some filesystem munging (like creating folders)
 - We'll set up a repo on GitHub and I'll demonstrate a sample project folder structure for organizing your reproducible research project

Licensing:
 - I know it sounds boring but if you anticipate anyone other than yourself using, adding to, modifying, or otherwise touching your work, you need a license.

Environments:
 - Probably the single most difficult part of making research reproducible
 - A little bit about environment management
 - Introduction to BinderHub
:::

## üîÅ Version Control

Version control is a workflow where the entire history of a set of documents is preserved.

**Why do we want our work under version control?**

::: {.notes}

Some good answers:
 - You can see everything added, removed, and changed at any point
 - You can review changes before they are made "official"
 - You can revert back to a previous version
 - You can restore a previous checkpoint if you lose your work

:::

## Why version control

![Tracking project history. DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3332807.](assets/project-history.svg)

::: {.incremental}

- Provenance
- Version history
- Hide older versions
- Distributed work
:::

::: {.notes}
- Provenance is the full history of something. This can be useful for many reasons, but one is so that invariable version changes in the underlying software or its dependencies can be understood so we know how e.g. a figure was generated, by looking at the history.
- Version history gives an auditable trail for why certain changes were made.
- Anyone have giant commented-out blocks of code? You can delete it now, safe in the knowledge that it still exists in the history you're recording through version control. If you need that code again, just go back to the version where it existed.
- Multiple different people can work on different parts, then merge their contributions--with their own histories intact!--so you have a complete picture even as more people are contributing.

## Create an account on GitHub

![](assets/github-signup.png)

## Create a repo

![](assets/create-repo.png)

## Create a repo

Fill out the form information.

::: {.incremental .r-fit-text}
 - **Repo name**: Something pithy that describes the project you're working on.
 - **Description**: A one-line summary of what you're using this repo for.
 - **Public / Private**: Suggest "public"  by default, but "private" during development and "public" during and after review also makes sense.
 - **Add a README**: This is where you'll go into detail about what your repo is doing. Definitely add this!
 - **Add .gitignore**: A bit more technical; depends on the work you're doing.
 - **Choose a license**: Absolutely yes--we'll go into more detail in the next section.
:::

## Create a folder structure

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](assets/repo-structure.png)
:::

::: {.column width="48%" .incremental}
 - This is a **suggestion**!
 - Use what is relevant, ignore what is not
 - (PSO: Don't put full data in version control. Sample data is great! Or, add `data/` to `.gitignore`)
:::

::: {.notes}
 - Items like a license, README, and `src` are must-haves.
 - `docs`, `notebooks`, `models`, and `data` (for sample data, perhaps) are great-to-haves.
 - For public-facing repos that are grown and maintained in the open, a Code of Conduct and Contributors documents are must-haves.
 - What else can you think of? 
:::

## Add everything to version control

## Version control workflow

![Many branches. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3332807).](assets/sub-branch.png)

## ü™™ Licensing

Licensing is how to spell out the rights of others to use, modify, or build on our work.

**Why is it important to give our work (code, data, content) a license?**

::: {.notes}
Some good answers:
- It's important to know how your work can be used when you put it out there
- It's important to know how you can use other people's work in your own research
- It's VERY important to know what your rights are should someone use your work in a way you did not intend (or if someone tries to take credit for your work)
:::

## Patents, Trademarks, and Copyright

Multiple kinds of intellectual property protection.

Here, we're focusing on **Copyright**.

Copyright can cover usage rights for:

 - Code
 - Data
 - Hardware
 - ML models
 - Content (slides, books, pictures, figures...)

## Choosing a license

How does one pick a license?

![](assets/license-table.png)

Fortunately, there's a handy flowchart!

[https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)

## Adding a license file to your repo

You can do this right when you create the repo!

## üåÖ Environments

Making your environment reproducible means configuring your work space--code, software, programs, even operating system--so that it is identical to the environment in which the research was originally done.

**Why is it important to have reproducible environments?**

::: {.notes}
Some good answers:

- The same person coming back to work they've paused for a few months may be unable to get their code to run, as surrounding software has changed and updated in that time.
- Getting a collaborator to run your code--how many times have we said "well it works on MY machine"?
- If anyone wanted to replicate your results, they would need a detailed breakdown of your environment.
- Debugging your code inherently relies on knowledge of what has changed and what has remained constant since the code last functioned correctly. Confidence in a replicable environment is critical for this process.

## How to "capture" an environment

![Computational environments. [DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3332807).](assets/computational-environments.png)

::: {.incremental}
1. Virtual machines
2. Docker / containers
3. Conda / Mamba
4. Binder
:::

::: {.notes}
- VMs are maybe the "easiest", but certainly the most massive, ways of passing an environment around. The drawback is the size: they often clock in well into the GBs. Preferable to this would be something more akin to a _recipe_ for building an environment locally.
- This "recipe" idea is what containers aim for. Dockerfiles enumerate the "recipe" for the environment, which are excecuted locally to build it.
- Where VMs and containers recreate entire compute environments, conda / mamba are package managers that are specific to coding environments (they often exist within VMs or containers). They can also specify recipes of specific coding packages and their versions that comprise a research environment.
- Binder is a self-contained platform that builds a coding environment like conda/mamba but without needing the command line or a local VM or container; all you need is a repo (on GitHub) and a web browser.
:::

## Virtual machines

VirtualBox or Vagrant

::: {.notes}
Pros/cons?

Has anyone ever done this before?
:::

## Containers

![](assets/docker.png)

Containers are often pitched as "lightweight VMs"

Build on millions of pre-built containers at [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/), or build your own from scratch via [Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/).

::: {.notes}
"Lightweight VM" is not really technically accurate, but in practice it's reasonable.

Pros/cons?

Has anyone ever used containers before?
:::

## Package management systems

![](assets/mamba.png)

[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) and [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) are most well known on the Python end

Use YAML to specify the environments

::: {.notes}
Pros/cons?

Has anyone ever used conda or mamba before?

Are there other package management systems folks have used?
:::

## Binder

![](assets/binder.png)

Converts a public repository into an active notebook environment, all via the web

Just specify the environment, and Binder does the rest!

::: {.notes}
Has anyone ever used Binder before?

Binder makes use of everything:
 - it's running in cloud infrastructure (VMs)
 - uses your environment specification (package management, YAML) to create the environment
 - spins up everything inside a custom-built Docker container

One major downside: it's very, very resource-intensive
 - while every effort is made to streamline image building--it watches for changes in repos, and only builds from that point--it's a very compute intensive process
 - we tested a BinderHub pilot locally at UGA, and decided we just didn't have the resources or the demand to justify it, not when mybinder.org still exists
 - a lot of universities ARE spinning up their own internal BinderHubs; if we need it, let us know!
