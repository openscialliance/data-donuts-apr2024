Welcome! These slides were built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). The easiest way to view them will be to click the links below, which should launch the slides in your browser.

**NOTE**: If you decide to clone the repository, make sure you preserve the structure and files! The HTML slides will reference images in the `assets` folder and Javascript files in the `*_files` folders, so you'll need everything here, not just the HTML files, to actually view them.

**Browser Note**: In developing these slides, I found Firefox to be problematic at best with viewing the slides. Chrome, however, seems to work perfectly.
