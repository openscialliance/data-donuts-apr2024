## This session

### Objectives
- Take a few moments to reflect on our own current or intended practices with data
- Identify opportunities and challenges, especially with respect to reproducibility

### Process
- Form discussion groups. 
- Take notes via the [HackMD](https://hackmd.io) collaborative notebook (links coming)  
- Very helpful if a few people take the notes and other's contribute to the discussion
    - Rotate this responsibility
    - Please take care to listen and be respectful of everyone's opinions
- Notes will be shared via the workshop GitHub repository

## Time to form groups!
- Aim for 5-7 people per group
- Better if you are not in the same research group
- Introduce yourselves (briefly, we'll start in 2 minutes)

## 1. Data Acquisition
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
1. **Data and Meta Data**
    - What types/forms of data do you each work with?  Write as many of these down as you can in a list. (e.g., photos)
    - What would be useful to know about how each of these types of data were collected? (think: Camera brand, field of view) 
    
2. **How can we balance the ideals of data collection with the practical challenges and constraints often faced in real-world research settings?**
    - List some data or data collection practices that you think you (or others) could document better and would be of high value
    - What form would that documentation take?

## 2. Raw Data Storage and Organization
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
1. **Storage**
    - Where do you tend to store raw data you've collected? (e.g., personal computer hard disk)
    - What are some of the challenges you face when storing your raw data? (e.g., limited capacity)
    
2. **Organization**
    - How do you tend to organize raw data as you are collecting it (or after you collect it), and where did that organizational practice come from?
    - What are some issues that an organizational strategy has addressed or causes for you (or others)?

    - What does it mean to you to "clean" data, and where do you put this data?
    - How do you incorporate and document manual steps? 
    
2. **Analyses**
    - What are some challenges you've faced, or foresee facing, when it comes to documenting how you've analyzed data?
